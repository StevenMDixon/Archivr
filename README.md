# Archivr

Archivr is a small application I wrote to help me wrangle my massive collection of commercials.
This is still very much a work in progress :-)

# File Name Meta Encoding

Part of management I want to be able to glean useful information about each of the files when processing them so that I can build queries for specific things.
For example if I wanted make a kids channel, I would obviously not want to include R/M rated commcercials. Maybe I have a preference around whether the commercial has 
a 3rd party watermark.
